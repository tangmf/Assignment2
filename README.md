### User stories

* As a car driver, I need to find a place to park. Using the web application, I will allow the website to know my location, and from my location, the website will find out the nearest places to park. I can then copy the location of the car park I would like to park in, and paste it on the map as my destination. I can then click on my current location, which will generate a route between one location to the other. I can then have the directions to go to the car park.

* As a car driver, I would like to find out information about car parks in Singapore. I can go the Search Page and enter in the keyword of the Car Park I want to find out about . The website will then show the details of the car park.
