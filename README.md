* As a driver, I want to find a close place to park. From using the website, I would navigate to Find parking, where car parks nearby would be displayed. I can then copy the location and paste it onto the destination on the map. Then, the website will show me the directions to the car park I had selected.
* I want to find the directions to a location. From using the website, I can navigate to Map, where I would need to allow the website to view my location. I can then enter my destination onto the map, and click on my current location. The website will then generate directions for me to reach my destination.
* I want to find out how much available lots there are. From using the website, I would need to navigate to Search, where I can find the available lots of the carpark through typing in the keyword. e.g. type in "Yishun", and all car parks with yishun in their name would be displayed along with their available lots.
