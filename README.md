## [1] Purpose

### User audience:
Car drivers.

### Intent:
Help drivers find a nearby place to park.

### Purpose:
Make finding a place to park easier.

### Who the website is catering for and value it provides for users:
Car drivers, makes finding parking easier, they can also find out the available lots left for each car park.

### What is the website catering for?
The website is catering a centralized place to distribute and sell content from K/DA.

## [2] Design Process

This website is made to promote K/DA's content, and act as a centralized place to distribute and sell content from K/DA to fans or going-to-be fans.
Hence, the website needs to have easily accessible content like music videos, music and merchandise, as well as match the flashy style of the band's brand.

I wanted the design of the website to be user friendly, and have the content (music) to be easily accessible for the user, and so the first step was to have a nice and simple navigation bar. For the layout of the website, I made it so that each page had sections, spaced away from one another to clearly distinguish them, and I wanted the text to be easy to read, and so went with a white text and black background. The font I chose, BarlowCondensed, makes reading the text easy to read as well, and gives the website texts a clean look.

### User stories

* As a car driver, I need to find a place to park. Using the web application, I will allow the website to know my location, and from my location, the website will find out the nearest places to park. I can then copy the location of the car park I would like to park in, and paste it on the map as my destination. I can then click on my current location, which will generate a route between one location to the other. I can then have the directions to go to the car park.
